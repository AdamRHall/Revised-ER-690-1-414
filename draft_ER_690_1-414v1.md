1-4**.** USACE Learning Center and School. The USACE Learning Center
located in Huntsville AL is the United States Army Corps of Engineers
Education Center of Excellence. The ULC is considered the “School House”
for the Corps of Engineers and has the inherent responsibility to
support all training needs of USACE Soldiers and Civilians. It is
expected that Proponents and Instructors supporting the PROSPECT program
will leverage and optimize the expertise of the ULC staff by scheduling
all instructor meetings at the ULC unless meetings can be accomplished
virtually. In addition, the ULC will be the first choice for scheduling
PROSPECT courses, that do not require instruction at an alternate
location to meet course objectives, once ULC reaches it fill rate of 85%
fill rate for the FY; a regional schedule will be used for those courses
not scheduled at ULC. Exception to the policy of utilizing ULC for
in-person instructor meetings may only be granted through HQ-CEHR-D and
the approval authority of this regulation.

1-5. PROSPECT Program Objectives. To support the overall objectives of
USACE as follows:

a. Develop the USACE work force and provide support to the Army.

> b. Assist USACE organizations in keeping abreast of changing missions
> and technology.
> 
> c. Identify, by a proponent system and other means, training
> programs/courses to meet work force training needs at all
> organizational levels.

d. Provide specific training to:

> (1) Maintain technical skills to assure competent job performance.
> 
> (2) Increase technical knowledge for professional growth.
> 
> (3) Teach new techniques, skills, and knowledge.
> 
> (4) Orient personnel new to USACE..
> 
> (5) Cross-train in other technical specialties.
> 
> (6) Prepare the work force for mobilization.

1-6. Training Course Structure. The PROSPECT Program encompasses all
training courses developed by or for USACE. The program consists of Face
to Face and Distance Learning Courses.

a. Types of courses.

> (1) In-House Course – A course that is conducted by USACE employees at
> the Corps’ School House USACE Learning Center, Huntsville, AL or a
> regional location. These types of courses are courses that require
> typical resources that are part of a typical “Face to Face” course
> including: books, multimedia presentations, student and instructor
> guides (not inclusive). Because these coursed do not require “unique”
> resources they may be scheduled at locations and classrooms outside of
> Huntsville to support a regional training concept. These courses are
> also available to be trained as onsite training using Mobile Training
> Teams when instructors are available.
> 
> (2) Training Agent Course – A course that is conducted at USACE
> organization such as a laboratory or center because of the unique
> resources that the organization, laboratory, or center has available
> to support specific learning outcomes. Courses that can be implemented
> at varying locations and are not driven by “unique” resources should
> not be considered a training agent course. Courses that require
> concrete mixing is an example of a training agent course. The “unique”
> resource cannot be provided at any classroom location throughout
> USACE. In addition, a training agent course cannot be offered as an
> onsite course.
> 
> (3) Contract Course – A course that is conducted through a contract
> where it has been deemed that the skills, knowledge, and abilities set
> required to develop and implement effective and efficient training
> does not exist within the USACE workforce. **Note:** Every effort
> should be made by Proponents to develop the expertise of Corps
> employees so that they can become instructors to support training and
> limit the use of contract training courses.
> 
> (4) On-Site Course (Mobile Training Team (MTT)) – A course that is
> requested by an organization to meet a specific training requirement.
> This is simply an In-House course that is Organizations requesting an
> on-site will coordinate directly with ULC and will not be allowed to
> open this training to organizations external to their Division. A by
> name list of students will be provided to the ULC Registrar once an
> on-site request has been approved. Cost savings is through the reduced
> travel cost for employees to attend.
> 
> (5) Asynchronous Distance Learning Course – A course that is
> implemented using the Internet and in most instances is considered
> Computer Based Training (CBT). These courses are usually implemented
> using the Army Learning Management System. These types of courses aims
> to: (1) Reduce training costs (particularly travel and per diem). (2)
> Take training and education to students rather than vice versa (3)
> Increase flexibility of scheduling training.
> 
> (6) Synchronous Distance Learning Course- A course that is implemented
> using the Internet in which students and instructors interact
> simultaneously as they would in a classroom. Interaction is supported
> by the use of cameras and microphones embedded in personal computing
> devices such as laptops, tablets, or phones. Interaction can also take
> place using Video teleconferencing.
> 
> (7) Blended/Hybrid Learning- A training course that takes place using
> a combination of distance learning technologies that can include
> Learning Management Systems, Videoconferencing or other virtual
> methods as well as face-to-face classroom instruction. Blended/hybrid
> learning can be used to support reduction time in the face-to-face
> classroom by allowing some of the topics that do not require
> application to be conducted as prerequisite to the face-to-face
> training.
> 
> b. Training Priority. A priority that must be specified for all types
> of formal training. Training that is not prioritized may not be
> conducted. Criteria for determining the appropriate priority for
> assigning is as follows:
> 
> (1) Priority I – Position Requirement Training- To meet position
> certification or position requirements.

(2) Priority II – Career Development Training- To become eligible for
their next certification level above their current certification level;
individual has met their position certification requirement.

> (3) Priority III – Cross Functional Training- For personnel who
> currently are in a position or career field different position or
> career field. All other mandatory trainings and certifications have
> been completed.

1-7. Operating Policies

a. General policies:

> (1) The ULC Director has overall responsibility of asset management
> for all resources. Resources are only available to a student and
> student’s organization that have paid tuition and successfully
> completed all course requirements. Release of resources is not
> authorized without approval by ULC Director.
> 
> (2) The PROSPECT Program is primarily job-related training to support
> current and anticipated USACE mission and career development training
> for the USACE Civilian and Military workforce. This will be based on a
> “doctrinal” approach that meets the Enterprise need of the USACE
> workforce.
> 
> (3) The PROSPECT Program is also available to DOD, Federal, state, and
> local government, employees on a reimbursable basis. USACE personnel
> have first priority for PROSPECT courses. The ULC is not authorized to
> accept payment from Government Contractors so therefore government
> contractors may not attend any PROSPECT course requiring cost
> reimbursement.
> 
> (4) Cost effectiveness will be considered when planning all PROSPECT
> courses.
> 
> (5) All PROSPECT courses will be developed/revised per the USACE
> Learning Center Pamphlet 350-70 Training Development Guide.
> 
> (a) ULC has overall responsibility for ensuring compliance to guide
> and maintaining an audit trail to document the rationale for actions
> taken. Documentation required for the audit trail is detailed in the
> Training Development Guide.
> 
> (b) In addition to ULC’s responsibility as the training designer/
> developer, the instructor/facilitator, and Proponent are responsible
> in their own function for applying the Systems Approach to Training
> (SAT) principles. The ULC Course Managers are responsible for working
> with Proponents and Instructors to design and develop all courses and
> materials to meet the requirements of the instructors/facilitators.
> All courses and material are considered under development until they
> are approved by the course Proponent.
> 
> (7) Generally, PROSPECT courses will not be developed or continued if
> ULC and the Proponent determines an equivalent course is available at
> a lower cost from other Government sources, private industry, or
> academia. If an equivalent and lower cost course is found, it should
> be considered for USACE members.
> 
> (8) The decision to develop any new course must be based on USACE
> training needs or support a current or future USACE mission and
> approved by the appropriate Community of Practice (CoP).
> 
> (9) Once a PROSPECT course is converted to a dL format and
> distributed, the resident phase of the course may be archived.
> 
> (10) HQUSACE may direct development of urgent PROSPECT courses. (See
> Directed Training, Appendix A.)

b. PROSPECT Training Program policies:

> (1) PROSPECT courses will be scheduled to meet the most urgent USACE
> training needs as expressed in the annual Training Needs Survey.
> Whenever possible, 100 percent of priority 1 training needs will be
> met. When feasible training needs that are priorities 2 and 3 will
> also be supported.
> 
> (2) All organizations using the PROSPECT Program will pay tuition
> specified for all spaces allocated (reserved) in each course per
> Chapter 2, and provide the necessary travel and per diem funds to
> support training.
> 
> (3) To maintain the integrity of the USACE Resident Training, ensure
> uniformity of training content, and avoid overutilization of
> instructors, unapproved, nonscheduled training sessions are not
> permitted. Therefore, PROSPECT training will not be scheduled without
> coordination and approval by the ULC Director.
> 
> (4) More specific guidelines covering the training program are
> contained in Chapter 3.
> 
> (5) To maintain the integrity of the PROSPECT Program and to ensure
> uniformity of training content, training materials will not be edited
> or reproduced without advance approval by the Director of ULC.
> 
> (6) The ULC is considered the “School House” for the, design,
> development United States Army Corps of Engineers and has experts in
> the areas of management, design, teaching, assessing, and facilitating
> all aspects of training and education. In order to maximize expertise
> of the ULC as the USACE Education Center of Excellence, Proponents
> will work with ULC course managers to schedule as many courses as
> possible at the School House in Huntsville, AL excluding those that
> must be implemented at site specific locations to support specific
> learning objective. In addition, all Instructor Meetings or any
> Workshops that requires Learning Center Expertise will be scheduled
> and implemented at the ULC in Huntsville when virtual meetings are not
> possible. An exception to the policy for conducting face to face
> instructor meetings outside of the ULC must be directed and approved
> through HQ-CEHR-D.
> 
> (7) Proponents and instructors will work with ULC course managers and
> technicians to implement an iterative analysis, design, development,
> implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) model. Course managers and
> technicians will design and develop materials and
> instructional/educational environments/experiences to meet the needs
> and expectations of proponents and instructors. A back-and-forth
> process of design/development by ULC personnel and input/approval of
> proponents/instructors will occur until all agree that all materials
> and educational experiences/environments are satisfactorily completed.

1-8. Organizational Responsibilities. The PROSPECT Program involves many
individuals and organizational elements. Specific responsibilities of
these individuals and activities are detailed in Chapter 4.

1-9. PROSPECT funding. ULC and PROSPECT is a fully reimbursable program.
PROSPECT operational execution is funded through the cost of tuition.

> a. Direct funding. The Proponent organization provides the funds for
> development and implementation of the training and education. Upon
> receiving a new training course proposal, ULC reviews the proposal
> with the Proponent to determine type of media needed. The HQUSACE
> Proponent/CoP will fund development and initial implementation (first
> year). Once a course is implemented tuition will fund the execution.
> 
> b. Reimbursable support. Reimbursable organizations will be provided
> labor, travel, and per diem for support to the PROSPECT program.
> Reimbursable costs will be factored into the program. Overhead costs
> are not reimbursable.
> 
> c. Annual Course Revisions. USACE Learning Center will annually
> coordinate with the proponent through the Verification of Training
> Needs (ENG Form 4712-R) for the review of materials on the fielding or
> revision date. Costs of course revisions will be factored into
> tuitions and be provided by ULC for update of course materials. When
> required, revisions of training materials will be focused on a
> doctrinal change accomplished immediately; this cost will be
> calculated into the annual tuition. Course revisions can be completed
> either as a standalone project by PROSPECT Instructors and Proponents
> or as part of instructor meetings if revisions are complex. All course
> revisions that require an in-person instructor meeting will take place
> at the ULC in Huntsville, AL. Course revisions should be planned on a
> three year cycle in accordance with U. S. Army training and
> development standards. Course managers and Proponents will work on the
> Develop, Review, and Revise guidance based in the TRADOC Training
> Development Description of Work.
> 
> d. Three Year Revision Cycle. Courses that have not been revised in
> the last three years will be evaluated by Course Managers and
> Proponents/Instructors to verify their currency. Based on this
> evaluation, revisions will be made as needed.

**CHAPTER 2**

**PROSPECT ANNUAL PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT**

2-1. General. This chapter describes PROSPECT Program development,
management, and funding.

2-2. Program Development and Implementation. All new or revised PROSPECT
courses developed by or for USACE will be developed and conducted in
accordance with the Systems Approach to Training Development, as
described in the ULC Training Development Guide.

2-3. Management. The Director, Headquarters Human Resources Directorate
has the executive oversight of the PROSPECT Program which is managed by
the Director of the USACE Learning Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

2-4. Planning and Operating Cycle.

> a. Identifying USACE training and education needs begins with the
> issue of ENG FORM 4712 Verification of Training Needs (4712) to the
> proponent NLT 5 October for next fiscal year (FY). Proponents will
> verify the need for existing courses for next FY and will provide
> proposed course dates, locations, number of sessions, related
> reimbursable costs (books, busses for fieldtrips) by returning the
> 4712 to USACE Learning Center NLT 5 December. Courses with
> insufficient number of students for sessions in three previous years’
> surveys will be archived and will not be included in the annual
> Training Needs Survey.
> 
> b. Proposed new courses will be submitted using the ENG FORM 4713
> Evaluation of Proposed Training Course as soon as possible to allow
> design/development in a timely manner. HQUSACE CoP/Proponent provides
> necessary funding for development and training execution first year.

c. Training Needs Survey

> (1) The ULC will prepare tuition, schedule for the specific courses,
> locations, dates, and number of sessions for inclusion in the Training
> Needs Survey for the next FY upon receipt of 4712 from Proponents (NLT
> 1 February). ULC managers will attempt to schedule classes using a
> regional method for high volume courses. However, emphasis will be
> placed to use the ULC facilities located in Huntsville, AL and fill it
> to maximum capacity. Proponents, Divisions, and Districts are expected
> to use the UKC facilities and acknowledge it as the Corps’ Educational
> Center of Excellence. The Training Needs Survey will be sent to the
> field via the ULC TMIS with a memorandum outlining instructions for
> completing the Survey in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Week of February.
> Organizations will have 8 weeks to complete the survey with a suspense
> to be returned NLT 3<sup>rd</sup> Week of April. Non-Corps program
> participants will be forwarded the survey via email to Training
> Coordinators with identical instructions with the exception of how to
> submit requirements.
> 
> (2) Upon closure of the survey, ULC will validate the schedule and
> sessions with allocations. Courses that have been scheduled for
> multiple sessions that are not filled to an optimum level for
> implementation will be consolidated based on priorities. This will
> ensure that each session is executed cost effectively and training
> needs are met.
> 
> (3) ULC will return the survey to the organizations NLT 1<sup>st</sup>
> week of May for verification and acceptance. ULC will notify
> organizations of the allocations they are to receive as a result of
> the Training Needs Survey. Organizations will have until the third
> week of June to accept the training schedule; after this date each
> organization will be financially responsible for those allocations.
> 
> (a) Organizations are obligated to verify and pay for spaces allocated
> per the Training Needs Survey.
> 
> (b) Allocations may differ from the Training Needs Survey due to
> changes in dates or locations of a session, or due to the addition or
> deletion of a session based on the number of students who requested a
> seat. In these cases the requesting organization may accept or refuse
> the allocations. Verification/acceptance includes the obligation to
> pay tuition. Non-acceptance removes the requirement for payment of
> tuition for these allocations.
> 
> (c) New or additional requirements, identified after the Training
> Needs Survey is completed, may be requested during the verification
> and acceptance stage. There will be no further verification of such
> new requirements. By indicating a need for these spaces, the
> requesting organization accepts the responsibility for the cost of the
> allocations it receives.
> 
> d. Announcement of upcoming FY schedule (NLT 1 August). The program
> schedule will be published in the USACE Learning Center Training
> Management Information System (TMIS) and posted on the USACE Learning
> Center web page.
> 
> e. Instructor identification (NLT 31 Jul). Proponents will assist
> USACE Learning Center by submitting names of instructors, by session,
> to USACE Learning Center for each course they sponsor.
> 
> f. Execution (1 Oct). USACE Learning Center will commence the
> operational fiscal year.

2-5. Tuition Payment Process. USACE Learning Center will send tuition
billings NLT 45 days prior to course sessions with exception of first
billing on/about 1 October. Billing will be made to the organizations
receiving allocations as specified in the verification and acceptance
phase. Consistent with the pay-as-you-go policy, each user element must
pay tuition NLT 30 days following receipt of the bill for the number of
its allocated spaces regardless of whether the spaces are actually used.
The following adjustments will be incorporated in the monthly billings:

> a. Pay.gov is the primary method of payment using the Government
> Purchase Card (GPC). Non-Corps organizations can pay for training in
> coordination with USACE Learning Center and Huntsville Center RM.

b. Additional allocations issued after survey will be billed
accordingly.

> c. Tuition must be paid for any attendee who is denied training at the
> course site on the basis of failing specified course prerequisites.

d. No charge will be made for allocations in cancelled courses.

> e. Qualified substitutes are allowed by each organization. However, if
> no qualified substitution is obtained, payment will be required of the
> activity receiving the allocation.

f. Payment is the responsibility of organization with issued allocation.
The original requesting organization for allocation will be billed,
regardless if this allocation is provided to another organization.

g. Training coordinators can request to be relieved from issued
allocations if there are changes in course schedule or course dates.
However, the training coordinator must provide a written memorandum
signed by the commander demonstrating that the change in schedule or
location has caused financial or mission adversity to the organization.
This memorandum must be received by the ULC registrar within 72 hours of
notification of the schedule or location change. **Note:** Changing a
course delivery method from Face-to-Face to virtual/online do not
constitute a schedule or location change.

2-6. Reimbursable Support. Many activities provide instruction and other
types of support to the training program. Organizations will provide
support costs, at a minimum, the breakout of labor, travel and per diem,
and other costs involved, this will not include overhead costs. Labor
costs for members whose salaries are paid from appropriated funds will
only be reimbursed for travel and per diem.

2-7. Tuition and Student costs for attending instructional training.
Once an employee is approved as an instructor by an organization, and
proponent, USACE Learning Center will coordinate training allocation.
USACE Learning Center will fund the labor (when required), travel, per
diem and tuition for instructor training. This requires a three year
commitment on the part of the instructor.

**CHAPTER 3 **

**DEVELOPMENT OF NEW/REVISED TRAINING COURSES**

3-1. General. This chapter explains the process and milestones to be
used to originate and develop new/revised training courses.

3-2. Policy. All courses will be developed utilizing the SAT process,
based on the Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate (ADDIE)
model as detailed USACE Learning Center Pamphlet 350-70 Training
Development Guide, dtd 1 April 2018.

3-3. Training Courses Development:

a. Origin.

> (1) Originator may suggest a new/revision of a course by completing
> ENG Form 4713-R, Evaluation of Proposed Training Course. This form is
> manually completed, and must be submitted to the appropriate Community
> of Practice (CoP) for approval.
> 
> (2) The HQUSACE Proponent will validate training requirement by
> conducting a formal needs assessment prior to forwarding to USACE
> Learning Center, the center can assist in the methods to accomplish
> the assessment.
> 
> (3) Upon receipt of approved Form 4713, the USACE Learning Center will
> validate through market research that this requirement cannot be met
> through another type of organization, government or civilian. This
> will also include a review of the appropriate media (Resident or dL)
> to meet this requirement. Criteria used to make this determination
> will include: stability of course content; applicability/suitability
> for either delivery mode; cost-benefit analysis; number of potential
> students; need for the course (in terms of urgency); and proponent’s
> recommendation. USACE Learning Center will develop milestones and
> coordinate the requirements to meet the implementation date.
> 
> (a) USACE Learning Center will prepare and coordinate with the
> proponent the specific course locations, dates, and number of
> sessions.
> 
> (b) The number of sessions will not exceed two for the initial
> operational year. USACE Learning Center will coordinate with the
> proponent to evaluate outcomes of the course after the execution of
> two pilot sessions.

b. Development process.

1)  The ADDIE Process supports the development of new courses as well as
    the revisions of current courses. The ADDIE process used by ULC is
    provided in the ULC Pamphlet 350-70, Training Development Guide, 1
    April 2016.

2)  Instructor Meetings- Instructor meetings are required in order to
    revise course material that is outdated because of change in
    regulations, procedures, technology or to create a validated new
    course. The meeting focus should be based on specific areas of the
    course that requires updated or new course material. Instructor
    meetings will be held at the USACE ULC in Huntsville, AL. unless
    exceptions can be justified. The most cost effective method for
    holding instructor meetings is using virtual meeting spaces. Course
    Managers, Proponents, and Instructors must ensure that the course
    revision remains focused and aligns with sound instructional design
    and educational development processes. The outcomes will be to make
    sure that measurable learning objective are developed, that learning
    content supports the learning objectives, and finally that the
    learning objectives are assessed in the posttest**. **
